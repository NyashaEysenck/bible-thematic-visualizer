# Thematic Bible Analysis Project Documentation

## Overview

The Thematic Bible Analysis project creates a sophisticated, AI-powered application for biblical study that integrates various data sources to provide users with a comprehensive and interactive way to explore scripture. By leveraging MongoDB's flexible data platform and Google's advanced AI models, the project transforms raw data into a structured, interconnected, and semantically searchable knowledge base.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Search**: Advanced vector-based search capabilities for finding relevant passages based on meaning rather than keywords
- **AI-Powered Enrichment**: Automated generation of theological summaries and content using Google's Gemini AI
- **Interconnected Knowledge Base**: Linked relationships between theological concepts, Bible books, and key events
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Combines Bible text, commentaries, and theological concepts from multiple authoritative sources

## Data Sources

| Source | Description | Format |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Bible XML** | Complete biblical text dataset | XML (sourced from Kaggle) |
| **Bible Commentary** | Custom scrapped from free web sources | PDF |
| **Theological Concepts** | Content adapted from the MacArthur Study Bible | Text/JSON |

## Core Technologies

### üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB

**Intelligent Data Platform**
- Serves as the foundational database for storing structured and unstructured data
- Flexible document model ideal for handling varied biblical text, commentaries, and theological concepts
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-native features with robust data handling and scalability
- **Vector Search**: Enables semantic searching across embedded text chunks

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Cloud AI

**Development Environment**
- **Google Colab**: Interactive notebook environment for seamless integration of Python code, AI models, and data processing

**AI Models**
- **gemini-2.0-flash**: Content generation for theological summaries and descriptions
- **text-embedding-004**: Vector embeddings creation for semantic search functionality
- **Generative AI**: Structured information extraction and thematic content generation

## System Architecture

The project follows a comprehensive multi-stage pipeline from raw data ingestion to a fully enriched and searchable database.

### Stage 1: Data Extraction and Structuring üìë

**PDF Processing**
- Utilizes PyMuPDF library to extract textual content from "Bible commentary" PDF
- Processes pages 21-1318 with intelligent content filtering
- Skips pages with minimal content to ensure data quality

**Content Organization**
- Identifies structural pages (e.g., "OLD TESTAMENT," "NEW TESTAMENT") for context
- Organizes extracted text into structured JSON objects containing:
  - Page number
  - Section (Testament)
  - Subsection
  - Chapter title
  - Full text content

**Output**: Clean JSON file (`commentary_chunks.json`) ready for processing

### Stage 2: Data Ingestion and Embedding üß†

**Database Connection**
- Establishes connection to MongoDB database (`bible_rag_db`)

**Embedding Process**
- Loads structured JSON data
- Processes each text chunk using Google's `text-embedding-004` model
- Generates vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning

**Data Storage**
- Stores text chunks with metadata and embeddings in `commentary_chunks` collection
- Successfully processed **1,254 text chunks**

### Stage 3: Content Generation and AI-Powered Enrichment ‚ú®

**Bible Books Collection**
- Creates dedicated `books` collection with metadata for all 66 Bible books
- Includes name, testament, and category information (Law, History, Gospel, etc.)

**Theological Summary Generation**
- Retrieves relevant commentary chunks for each Bible book
- Uses Gemini 2.0 to generate structured JSON summaries including:
  - Comprehensive overview
  - Key scripture references
  - Theological context
- Enhances `books` collection with generated content

**Theological Concepts Enhancement**
- Processes theological concepts collection with AI-generated:
  - Concise one-sentence descriptions
  - Thematic color schemes (primary and accent colors in hex format)
  - Normalized kebab-case IDs for easy referencing
- Updates `theology` collection with enriched fields

**Summary Standardization**
- Converts detailed verse references to simplified book references
- Generates embeddings for standardized summaries
- Stores both standardized content and embeddings in `theology` collection

### Stage 4: Data Cleaning, Normalization, and Interlinking üîó

**Data Integrity**
- **Chapter Title Normalization**: Standardizes inconsistent titles using custom overrides and regular expressions
- **Book Name Standardization**: Maps common Bible book abbreviations to full names
- **Reference Consistency**: Ensures uniform logging in `book_reference_stats` field

**Concept Linking**
- Links theological concepts to Bible books with:
  - **Prominence Scoring**: Calculates scores (1-5) based on reference frequency
  - **Event Generation**: Uses Gemini to generate lists of key biblical events
  - **Structured Storage**: Maintains `connections` array with book IDs, prominence scores, and associated events
