We teach that the Bible constitutes the only infallible rule of faith and practice (as seen in Matthew, John, 1 Corinthians, 2 Timothy, Hebrews, and 2 Peter). We teach that God spoke in his written word by a process of dual authorship. The Holy Spirit so superintended the human authors that, through their individual personalities and different styles of writing, they composed and recorded God’s word to man (as seen in 2 Peter) without error in the whole or in the part (as seen in Matthew and 2 Timothy). We teach that, whereas there may be several applications of any given passage of Scripture, there is but one true interpretation. The meaning of Scripture is to be found as one diligently applies the literal, grammatical-historical method of interpretation under the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit (as seen in John, 1 Corinthians, and 1 John).

We teach that God the Father created “the heavens and the earth and all that is in  them” according to his own will, through his Son, Jesus Christ, by whom all  things continue in existence and in operations (as seen in John, Colossians and Hebrews).  We teach that in the incarnation (God becoming man) Christ surrendered only  the prerogatives of deity but nothing of the divine essence, either in degree or  kind. In his incarnation, the eternally existing second person of the Trinity  accepted all the essential characteristics of humanity and so became the God-  man (as seen in Philippians and Colossians).  We teach that Jesus Christ represents humanity and deity in indivisible oneness  (as seen in Micah, John and Colossians).  We teach that our Lord Jesus Christ was virgin born (as seen in Isaiah, Matthew and Luke); that he was God incarnate (as seen in John); and that the purpose of  the incarnation was to reveal God, redeem men, and rule over God’s kingdom  (as seen in Psalm, Isaiah, John, Philippians, Hebrews and 1 Peter).  We teach that, in the incarnation, the second person of the Trinity laid aside his  right to the full prerogatives of coexistence with God, assumed the place of a  Son, and took on an existence appropriate to a servant while never divesting  himself of his divine attributes (as seen in Philippians).  We teach that our Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through the  shedding of his blood and sacrificial death on the cross and that his death was  voluntary, vicarious, substitutionary, propitiatory, and redemptive (as seen in John, Romans and 1 Peter).  We teach that on the basis of the efficacy of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ,  the believing sinner is freed from the punishment, the penalty, the power, and  one day the very presence of sin; and that he is declared righteous, given eternal  life, and adopted into the family of God (as seen in Romans, 2 Corinthians and 1 Peter).  We teach that our justification is made sure by his literal, physical resurrection  from the dead and that he is now ascended to the right hand of the Father, where  he now mediates as our Advocate and High Priest (as seen in Matthew, Luke, Acts, Romans, Hebrews and 1 John).  We teach that in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the grave, God confirmed  the deity of his Son and gave proof that God has accepted the atoning work of  Christ on the cross. Jesus’ bodily resurrection is also the guarantee of a future  resurrection life for all believers (as seen in John, Romans and 1 Corinthians).  We teach that Jesus Christ will return to receive the church, which is his body,  unto himself at the rapture and, returning with his church in glory, will establish  his millennial kingdom on earth (as seen in Acts, 1 Thessalonians and Revelation).  We teach that the Lord Jesus Christ is the one through whom God will judge all mankind (as seen in John):  I. Believers (as seen in 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians);  II. Living inhabitants of the earth at his glorious return (as seen in Matthew);  and  III. Unbelieving dead at the great white throne (as seen in Revelation).  As the mediator between God and man (as seen in 1 Timothy), the head of his body the  church (as seen in Ephesians and Colossians), and the coming universal King who will  reign on the throne of David (as seen in Isaiah, Ezekiel and Luke), he is  the final judge of all who fail to place their trust in him as Lord and Savior  (as seen in Matthew and Acts).\"\n","}\n","```\n","\n","🧠 Generating embedding for God The Son...\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\r4it [00:20,  5.09s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["✅ Updated God The Son with standardized summary and embedding\n","\n","🔄 Processing God the Holy Spirit...\n","📜 Standardization response for God the Holy Spirit:\n","```json\n","{\n","  \"standardized_summary\": \"We teach that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, eternal, underived, possessing  all the attributes of personality and deity, including intellect (as seen in 1 Corinthians),  emotions (as seen in Ephesians), will (as seen in 1 Corinthians), eternality (as seen in Hebrews), omnipresence  (as seen in Psalms), omniscience (as seen in Isaiah), omnipotence (as seen in Romans), and  truthfulness (as seen in John). In all the divine attributes he is coequal and  consubstantial with the Father and the Son (as seen in Matthew, Acts, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Jeremiah, and Hebrews).  We teach that it is the work of the Holy Spirit to execute the divine will with  relation to all mankind. We recognize his sovereign activity in the creation (as seen in Genesis), the incarnation (as seen in Matthew), the written revelation (as seen in 2 Peter), and the  work of salvation (as seen in John).  We teach that a unique work of the Holy Spirit in this age began at Pentecost  when he came from the Father as promised by Christ (as seen in John) to  initiate and complete the building of the body of Christ. His activity includes  convicting the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; glorifying the  Lord Jesus Christ and transforming believers into the image of Christ (as seen in John, Acts, Romans, 2 Corinthians and Ephesians).  We teach that the Holy Spirit is the supernatural and sovereign agent in  regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ (as seen in 1 Corinthians). The  Holy Spirit also indwells, sanctifies, instructs, empowers them for service, and  seals them unto the day of redemption (as seen in Romans, 2 Corinthians and Ephesians).  We teach that the Holy Spirit is the divine teacher who guided the apostles and  prophets into all truth as they committed to writing God’s revelation, the Bible (as seen in 2 Peter). Every believer possesses the indwelling presence of the Holy  Spirit from the moment of salvation, and it is the duty of all those born of the  Spirit to be filled with (controlled by) the Spirit (as seen in Romans, Ephesians, and 1 John).  We teach that the Holy Spirit administers spiritual gifts to the church. The Holy  Spirit glorifies neither himself nor his gifts by ostentatious displays, but he does  glorify Christ by implementing his work of redeeming the lost and building up  believers in the most holy faith (as seen in John, Acts, 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians).  We teach, in this respect, that God the Holy Spirit is sovereign in the bestowing  of all his gifts for the perfecting of the saints today and that speaking in tongues  and the working of sign miracles in the beginning days of the church were for  the purpose of pointing to and authenticating the apostles as revealers of divine  truth, and were never intended to be characteristic of the lives of believers (as seen in 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Hebrews).\"\n","}\n","```\n","\n","🧠 Generating embedding for God the Holy Spirit...\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\r5it [00:25,  5.13s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["✅ Updated God the Holy Spirit with standardized summary and embedding\n","\n","🔄 Processing Man...\n","📜 Standardization response for Man:\n","```json\n","{\n","  \"standardized_summary\": \"We teach that man was directly and immediately created by God in his image  and likeness.

We teach that in Adam’s sin of disobedience to the revealed will and word of  God, man lost his innocence; incurred the penalty of spiritual and physical death;  became subject to the wrath of God; and became inherently corrupt and utterly  incapable of choosing or doing that which is acceptable to God apart from divine  grace. With no recuperative powers to enable him to recover himself, man is  hopelessly lost. Man’s salvation is thereby wholly of God’s grace through the  redemptive work of our Lord Jesus Christ (as seen in Genesis, John, Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, 1 Timothy, and 1 John).  We teach that because all men were in Adam, a nature corrupted by Adam’s sin  has been transmitted to all men of all ages, Jesus Christ being the only exception.

Nevertheless, since  sovereign grace includes the means of receiving the gift of salvation as well as  the gift itself, sovereign election will result in what God determines. All whom  the Father calls to himself will come in faith and all who come in faith the Father  will receive (as seen in John, Acts, and James).  We teach that the unmerited favor that God grants to totally depraved sinners is  not related to any initiative of their own part nor to God’s anticipation of what  they might do by their own will, but is solely of his sovereign grace and mercy  (as seen in Ephesians, Titus, and 1 Peter).  We teach that election should not be looked upon as based merely on abstract  sovereignty. God is truly sovereign but he exercises this sovereignty in harmony  with his other attributes, especially his omniscience, justice, holiness, wisdom,  grace, and love (as seen in Romans).

The believer is able to live a life of increasing holiness in conformity to  the will of God, becoming more and more like our Lord Jesus Christ (as seen in John, Romans, 2 Corinthians, and 1 Thessalonians).

We teach that the formation of the church, the body of Christ, began on the day  of Pentecost, as seen in Acts and will be completed at the coming of Christ  for his own at the rapture, as seen in 1 Corinthians and 1 Thessalonians.  We teach that the church is thus a unique spiritual organism designed by Christ,  made up of all born-again believers in this present age, as seen in Ephesians. The  church is distinct from Israel, as seen in 1 Corinthians, a mystery not revealed until this age, as seen in Ephesians.  We teach that the establishment and continuity of local churches is clearly taught  and defined in the New Testament Scriptures, as seen in Acts, Galatians, Philippians, and Thessalonians and that the members of the one  spiritual body are directed to associate themselves together in local assemblies, as seen in 1 Corinthians and Hebrews.  We teach that the one supreme authority for the church is Christ, as seen in Ephesians and Colossians and that church leadership, gifts, order, discipline, and worship are all  appointed through his sovereignty as found in the Scriptures. The biblically  designated officers serving under Christ and over the assembly are elders (males,  who are also called bishops, pastors, and pastor-teachers), as seen in Acts and Ephesians and deacons, both of whom must meet biblical qualifications, as seen in 1 Timothy, Titus, and 1 Peter.  We teach that these leaders lead or rule as servants of Christ, as seen in 1 Timothy and have his authority in directing the church. The congregation is to submit to  their leadership, as seen in Hebrews.  We teach the importance of discipleship, as seen in Matthew and 2 Timothy, mutual  accountability of all believers to each other, as seen in Matthew, as well as the need  for discipline for sinning members of the congregation in accord with the standards of Scripture, as seen in Matthew, Acts, 1 Corinthians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, and Titus.  We teach the autonomy of the local church, free from any external authority or  control, with the right of self-government and freedom from the interference of  any hierarchy of individuals or organizations, as seen in Titus. We teach that it is  scriptural for true churches to cooperate with each other for the presentation and  propagation of the faith. Local churches, however, through their pastors and their  interpretation and application of Scripture, should be the sole judges of the  measure and method of their cooperation, as seen in Acts, 1 Corinthians, and 1 Peter.  We teach that the purpose of the church is to glorify God, as seen in Ephesians by building  itself up in the faith, as seen in Ephesians, by instruction of the word, as seen in 2 Timothy, by fellowship, as seen in Acts and 1 John, by keeping the ordinances, as seen in Luke and Acts and by advancing and communicating the gospel to  the entire world, as seen in Matthew and Acts.  We teach the calling of all saints to the work of service, as seen in 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Revelation.  We teach the need of the church to cooperate with God as he accomplishes his  purpose in the world. To that end, he gives the church spiritual gifts. First, he  gives men chosen for the purpose of equipping the saints for the work of the  ministry, as seen in Ephesians and he also gives unique and special spiritual abilities to  each member of the body of Christ, as seen in Romans, 1 Corinthians, and 1 Peter.  We teach that there were two kinds of gifts given the early church: miraculous  gifts of divine revelation and healing, given temporarily in the apostolic era for  the purpose of confirming the authenticity of the apostles’ message, as seen in Hebrews and 2 Corinthians; and ministering gifts, given to equip believers for edifying one  another. With the New Testament revelation now complete, Scripture becomes  the sole test of the authenticity of a man’s message, and confirming gifts of a  miraculous nature are no longer necessary to validate a man or his message, as seen in 1 Corinthians. Miraculous gifts can even be counterfeited by Satan so as to  deceive even believers, as seen in Matthew. The only gifts in operation today are those  non-revelatory equipping gifts given for edification, as seen in Romans.  We teach that no one possesses the gift of healing today but that God does hear  and answer the prayer of faith and will answer in accordance with his own  perfect will for the sick, suffering, and afflicted, as seen in Luke, John, 2 Corinthians, James, and 1 John.  We teach that two ordinances have been committed to the local church: baptism  and the Lord’s Supper, as seen in Acts. Christian baptism by immersion, as seen in Acts, is the solemn and beautiful testimony of a believer showing forth his  faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Savior, and his union with him in death to  sin and resurrection to a new life, as seen in Romans. It is also a sign of fellowship  and identification with the visible body of Christ, as seen in Acts.  We teach that the Lord’s Supper is the commemoration and proclamation of his  death until he comes, and should be always preceded by solemn self-  examination, as seen in 1 Corinthians. We also teach that whereas the elements of  communion are only representative of the flesh and blood of Christ, the Lord’s  Supper is nevertheless an actual Communion with the risen Christ who is present  in a unique way, fellowshiping with his people, as seen in 1 Corinthians.\"\n","}\n","```\n","\n","🧠 Generating embedding for The Church...\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\r14it [00:59,  4.82s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["✅ Updated The Church with standardized summary and embedding\n","\n","🔄 Processing Holy Angels...\n","📜 Standardization response for Holy Angels:\n","```json\n","{\n","  \"standardized_summary\": \"We teach that angels are created beings and are therefore not to be worshiped.

Until that time, the souls of the redeemed in Christ remain in joyful fellowship with our Lord Jesus Christ (as seen in 2 Corinthians).  We teach the bodily resurrection of all men, the saved to eternal life (as seen in John, Romans and 2 Corinthians), and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment (as seen in Daniel, John and Revelation).
